          <h1>Why Do People Love Coding?</h1>
          <p >
            Programming exploded in popularity during the last decade. And a lot of that hype appeared from the prospect of landing a high-paying job. But, in reality, there are so many other advantages of coding. And truth to be told, there is a lot to love about it.

                <h2>Human Ingenuity</h2>
                <p>
                  The ever-evolving world of the automotive industry is a testament to human ingenuity. Improvements in car manufacturing take place in leaps and bounds. Modern cars are streaks ahead from cars a hundred years ago. The cars we drive today provide comfortable, smooth rides, and very importantly gives us more mileage for our money than before. They are in fact one of the greatest success stories of the 20th century.

                <h2>Unprecedented Freedom</h2>
                <p>
                  Motor cars are a symbol of our individual freedom and personal independence. Owning our first vehicle meant not having to rely on any one else to reach our intended destinations or be hindered by someone else’s availability or lack thereof.

                <h2>Psychological Benefits</h2>
                <p>
                  In a UK study in 2003 it was found that cars give both men and women positive feelings of status and independence, yet only men derived increased self-esteem and psychological benefits from automobiles. In the psychology of cars it’s true to say that the romance between men and their cars do not exist in the same way with women and theirs.

                <h2> The Need for Speed</h2>
                <p>
                  When we get behind the wheel of a car it becomes an extension of ourselves. Controlling the mechanisms to power it forward allows us to achieve impossibilities within our own limitations. In human history, speed and the ability to move faster than your pursuer or pursued was more than just an advantage; it was a necessity for survival. In a way this explains why there is a certain competiveness between motorists on a street to arrive at the traffic lights first.
